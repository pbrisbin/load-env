# load-env

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbrisbin/load-env.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbrisbin/load-env)

This is effectively a port of [dotenv][], whose README explains it best:

> Storing configuration in the environment is one of the tenets of a
> twelve-factor app. Anything that is likely to change between deployment
> environments–such as resource handles for databases or credentials for
> external services–should be extracted from the code into environment
> variables.
>
> But it is not always practical to set environment variables on development
> machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run.
> dotenv loads variables from a .env file into ENV when the environment is
> bootstrapped.

This library exposes functions for doing just that.

## Usage

```haskell
import LoadEnv
import System.Environment (lookupEnv)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    loadEnv

    print =<< lookupEnv "FOO"
```

```console
% cat .env
FOO=bar
% runhaskell main.hs
Just "bar"
```

## Development & Test
